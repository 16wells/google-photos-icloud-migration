# Security Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Auditor:** Security Review (White Hat / Defensive Security)  
**Tool:** Google Photos to iCloud Photos Migration

## Executive Summary

This security audit reviewed the codebase for common vulnerabilities including:
- Secret/credential leakage risks
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Path traversal attacks (zip slip)
- Authentication and token storage issues
- Sensitive data logging
- Supply chain risks

**Overall Security Posture: GOOD** - The codebase demonstrates good security practices with proper path validation, safe subprocess usage, and appropriate handling of sensitive data.

## Findings

### ✅ CRITICAL FIXED: Documentation Misleading About credentials.json

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Risk:** Credential leakage, account compromise

**Issue:** Documentation incorrectly stated `credentials.json` was "safe to share". In reality, it contains OAuth client secrets that should be treated as sensitive.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md` and `CLOUD_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to correctly state credentials.json contains sensitive OAuth client secrets
- Removed misleading "safe to share" language
- Added warnings to never commit credentials.json to public repositories

**Impact:** Prevents accidental credential sharing/exposure

---

### ✅ FIXED: Token Storage Security

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Risk:** Token theft, unauthorized access

**Issue:** OAuth tokens stored in project directory with default permissions (world-readable in some cases).

**Fix Applied:**
- Token storage now defaults to `~/.config/google-photos-icloud-migration/token.json`
- Backward compatible with existing `token.json` in project directory
- Sets file permissions to 0600 (owner read/write only) where possible
- Improved token file location detection in verification scripts

**Impact:** Reduces risk of token theft through file system access

---

### ✅ FIXED: Password Length Logging

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Severity:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Risk:** Information disclosure

**Issue:** Password length was logged, which could aid brute-force attacks (provides information about password complexity).

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed password length logging from `icloud_uploader.py`

**Impact:** Reduces information leakage about authentication credentials

---

### ✅ VERIFIED: Zip Slip Protection

**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (Well Protected)

**Assessment:** Excellent implementation of zip slip protection.

**Location:** `google_photos_icloud_migration/processor/extractor.py` lines 76-88

**Protection Mechanisms:**
1. ✅ Resolves extraction directory to absolute path
2. ✅ Validates each path from zip file before extraction
3. ✅ Uses `pathlib.Path.relative_to()` to ensure paths stay within extraction directory
4. ✅ Raises `ExtractionError` if path traversal detected
5. ✅ Security utility function `is_safe_zip_path()` available (though current implementation uses inline validation)

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. Current implementation is secure.

---

### ✅ VERIFIED: Subprocess Security

**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (Well Protected)

**Assessment:** All subprocess calls use safe practices.

**Findings:**
- ✅ No instances of `shell=True` found
- ✅ All subprocess calls use list arguments (prevents injection)
- ✅ File paths validated before passing to subprocess (via `validate_subprocess_path()`)
- ✅ ExifTool calls use proper argument formatting with `=` syntax for tag values
- ✅ ffmpeg calls properly escape arguments

**Examples:**
- `metadata_merger.py`: Uses list args for ExifTool
- `video_converter.py`: Uses list args for ffmpeg, validates paths
- `check_terminal_permission.py`: Safe subprocess usage

**Recommendation:** Continue current practices. No changes needed.

---

### ✅ VERIFIED: YAML Loading Security

**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (Well Protected)

**Assessment:** Uses safe YAML loading.

**Findings:**
- ✅ Uses `yaml.safe_load()` throughout codebase
- ✅ No use of unsafe `yaml.load()` or `yaml.unsafe_load()`

**Recommendation:** No changes needed.

---

### ✅ VERIFIED: Path Validation

**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (Well Protected)

**Assessment:** Good path validation utilities in place.

**Location:** `google_photos_icloud_migration/utils/security.py`

**Features:**
- ✅ `validate_config_path()` - Prevents path traversal in config files
- ✅ `validate_file_path()` - Ensures files stay within base directory
- ✅ `is_safe_zip_path()` - Zip slip protection helper
- ✅ `sanitize_filename()` - Removes dangerous characters
- ✅ `validate_subprocess_path()` - Validates paths before subprocess calls

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. Good security utilities.

---

### ⚠️ MINOR: Logging of Sensitive Operations

**Status:** ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (Minor)  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Risk:** Information disclosure

**Findings:**
- ✅ No actual passwords/tokens/secrets logged
- ⚠️ Error messages mention "password" and "credentials" but don't expose values
- ✅ Uses `getpass.getpass()` for password input (good)

**Recommendation:** Current practice is acceptable. Error messages are informative without exposing sensitive data.

---

### ⚠️ MINOR: GitHub Token Script

**Status:** ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (Minor)  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Risk:** Token exposure in process list

**Location:** `scripts/set_github_repo_info.py`

**Findings:**
- ✅ Token read from environment variable or `.env` file (good)
- ✅ Token can be passed as command-line argument (acceptable for scripting)
- ⚠️ Token passed in HTTP header could be visible in process list during script execution

**Recommendation:** 
- Current implementation is acceptable for utility scripts
- For production use, consider using GitHub CLI or SSH keys where possible
- Document that tokens in process lists are a known limitation

---

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Dependency Security

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Risk:** Supply chain attacks

**Implementation:**
1. ✅ **Added dependency vulnerability scanning script:**
   - `scripts/check_dependencies.py` - Checks dependencies using `pip-audit`
   - Can be run manually or integrated into CI/CD
   - Supports `--fix` flag for automatic vulnerability fixes

2. ✅ **Added lock file generation script:**
   - `scripts/generate_lockfile.py` - Generates `requirements-lock.txt` with exact versions
   - Uses `pip-tools` for reproducible builds
   - Documents installation from lock file

3. ✅ **Enhanced SECURITY.md:**
   - Added dependency security section with `pip-audit` instructions
   - Documented dependency update process
   - Included best practices for supply chain security

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
python scripts/check_dependencies.py

# Generate lock file
python scripts/generate_lockfile.py

# Install from lock file (for reproducible builds)
pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
```

### 📋 TODO: Symlink Handling in Extraction

**Status:** 📋 RECOMMENDATION  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Risk:** Symlink attacks during extraction

**Current State:**
- Zip slip protection prevents directory traversal
- No explicit symlink handling in extraction code
- Python's `zipfile` module follows symlinks if they exist in zip (rare but possible)

**Recommendation:**
- Consider adding symlink detection before extraction
- Optionally skip symlinks or validate their targets
- Document in SECURITY.md that symlinks in zip files are not explicitly handled (low risk for Google Takeout zips)

---

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED: File Permissions on Created Files

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Risk:** Overly permissive files

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Token files have proper permissions (0600) 
- ✅ **Extraction directory permissions:** Set to 0700 (owner access only) after extraction
- ✅ **Extracted file permissions:** Set to 0600 (owner read/write) for files, 0700 for directories
- ✅ **Processed file permissions:** Set to 0600 (owner read/write) when copying to processed directory
- ✅ Graceful handling if permission setting fails (logs debug message, doesn't fail operation)

**Location:**
- `google_photos_icloud_migration/processor/extractor.py` - Extraction permissions
- `google_photos_icloud_migration/processor/metadata_merger.py` - Processed file permissions

**Note:** Permission setting may fail on some systems (e.g., network filesystems), but the code handles this gracefully without failing the operation.

---

### ✅ VERIFIED: Authentication Flows

**Status:** ✅ SECURE  
**Severity:** N/A (Well Designed)

**Assessment:** Good authentication practices.

**Google OAuth:**
- ✅ Uses OAuth 2.0 (industry standard)
- ✅ Read-only scope (`drive.readonly`)
- ✅ Token refresh handled automatically
- ✅ Clear error messages for expired tokens

**iCloud Authentication:**
- ✅ Password prompted securely with `getpass.getpass()`
- ✅ Supports 2FA
- ✅ Cookie storage in user directory (`~/.pyicloud`)
- ✅ Cookie directory permissions set to 0700

**Recommendation:** No changes needed.
