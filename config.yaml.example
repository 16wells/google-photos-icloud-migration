  folder_id: ""
  # Or search by name pattern
  zip_file_pattern: "takeout-*.zip"

# iCloud Configuration
icloud:
  # Apple ID email (can also use ICLOUD_APPLE_ID environment variable)
  # SECURITY: For production, prefer using environment variables instead of storing in config file
  apple_id: "your-apple-id@example.com"
  # Password (or leave empty to be prompted)
  # SECURITY: Leave empty to be prompted, or use ICLOUD_PASSWORD environment variable
  # Never commit passwords to version control!
  password: ""
  # Trusted device ID (optional, for 2FA non-interactive mode)
  # Device number (0, 1, 2, etc.) from the trusted devices list
  # Can also be set via ICLOUD_2FA_DEVICE_ID environment variable
  trusted_device_id: ""
  # 2FA verification code (optional, for non-interactive mode)
  # Can also be set via ICLOUD_2FA_CODE environment variable
  # Note: Codes expire quickly (typically 10 minutes)
  two_fa_code: ""
  # Photos library path (optional, for --use-sync method on macOS)
  # If not specified, defaults to ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary
  # photos_library_path: "~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary"

# Processing Configuration
processing:
  # Base directory for processing files
  base_dir: "/tmp/google-photos-migration"
  # Directory for downloaded zip files
  zip_dir: "zips"
  # Directory for extracted files
  extracted_dir: "extracted"
  # Directory for processed files (with metadata merged)
  processed_dir: "processed"
  # Batch size for processing (number of files to process at once)
  batch_size: 100
  # Clean up extracted files after processing
  cleanup_after_upload: true
  # Maximum number of parallel workers (null = auto-detect, recommended)
  max_workers: null
  # Enable parallel processing for faster operations
  enable_parallel_processing: true

# Metadata Configuration
metadata:
  # Preserve dates from PhotoTakenTimeTimestamp
  preserve_dates: true
  # Preserve GPS coordinates
  preserve_gps: true
  # Preserve descriptions
  preserve_descriptions: true
  # Preserve album information
  preserve_albums: true

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  file: "migration.log"

# Environment Variables (Alternative to config file for sensitive data)
# Create a .env file in the project directory (never commit it to git!)
# Example .env file contents:
#   ICLOUD_APPLE_ID=your-apple-id@example.com
#   ICLOUD_PASSWORD=your-password
#   ICLOUD_2FA_CODE=123456
#   ICLOUD_2FA_DEVICE_ID=0
#   GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json
#
# Environment variables take precedence over config file values for security.
# This allows you to keep credentials out of version control.
