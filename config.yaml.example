# Google Drive Configuration
google_drive:
  # Path to Google Drive API credentials JSON file
  # Download from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
  # Can also be set via GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable
  credentials_file: "credentials.json"
  # Folder ID in Google Drive containing the zip files (optional, leave empty to search)
  folder_id: ""
  # Or search by name pattern
  zip_file_pattern: "takeout-*.zip"

# iCloud Configuration (PhotoKit Sync Method - macOS only)
icloud:
  # Photos library path (optional)
  # If not specified, defaults to ~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary
  # Only needed if you want to use a non-default Photos library location
  # photos_library_path: "~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary"
  #
  # Note: No authentication credentials needed!
  # The tool uses your macOS iCloud account automatically via PhotoKit.
  # Make sure you're signed into iCloud on your Mac and iCloud Photos is enabled in System Settings.

# Processing Configuration
processing:
  # Base directory for processing files
  base_dir: "/tmp/google-photos-migration"
  # Directory for downloaded zip files
  zip_dir: "zips"
  # Directory for extracted files
  extracted_dir: "extracted"
  # Directory for processed files (with metadata merged)
  processed_dir: "processed"
  # Maximum disk space to use (in GB). Set to 0 or null for unlimited
  # The program will stop downloading new files when this limit is reached
  # Minimum: 10 GB, Recommended: 50+ GB for large libraries
  max_disk_space_gb: null  # null = unlimited
  # Batch size for processing (number of files to process at once)
  batch_size: 100
  # Clean up extracted files after processing
  cleanup_after_upload: true
  # Maximum number of parallel workers (null = auto-detect, recommended)
  max_workers: null
  # Enable parallel processing for faster operations
  enable_parallel_processing: true
  # Maximum number of parallel uploads to iCloud (default: 5, recommended: 5-10)
  # Higher values = faster uploads but may hit API rate limits
  # Set to 1 to disable parallel uploads (sequential, slower but safer)
  max_parallel_uploads: 5

# Metadata Configuration
metadata:
  # Preserve dates from PhotoTakenTimeTimestamp
  preserve_dates: true
  # Preserve GPS coordinates
  preserve_gps: true
  # Preserve descriptions
  preserve_descriptions: true
  # Preserve album information
  preserve_albums: true

# Logging Configuration
logging:
  level: "INFO"
  file: "migration.log"

# Environment Variables (Alternative to config file for sensitive data)
# Create a .env file in the project directory (never commit it to git!)
# Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your values
# Example .env file contents:
#   GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json
#   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here  # For scripts/set_github_repo_info.py (optional, developer use only)
#
# Note: iCloud credentials are NOT needed - the tool uses your macOS iCloud account
#       automatically via PhotoKit. No ICLOUD_APPLE_ID, ICLOUD_PASSWORD, etc. required.
#
# Environment variables take precedence over config file values for security.
# This allows you to keep credentials out of version control.
